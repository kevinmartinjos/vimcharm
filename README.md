## VimCharm

Approximating PyCharm on Vim.

See [this](https://kevinmartinjose.com/2020/11/22/vimcharm-approximating-pycharm-on-vim/) blog post for details.

**N.B**: Simply copy-pasting the .vimrc will not work since some maps involve character sequences that won't be escaped properly if you simply copy-paste
